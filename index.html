            <p class="project-description">
              In this semester project our task was to design an ecosystem intervention individually within a pre-defined problem space and formalise that intervention in a digital product.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
              Physical isolation, limited economic diversity, and higher poverty rates, combined with an ageing population, increase the vulnerability of rural communities to any crisis, including the current permacrisis. Systems of fundamental importance to rural populations are already stressed by remoteness and limited access - climate change is only making this worse.

            <h4 class="project-section">Primary Issues</h4>

            <p class="project-description">  
              Effects of climate change: Rural communities tend to rely heavily on climatesensitive resources such as local water supplies and agricultural land; climate-sensitive activities such as arable farming and livestock husbandry; and natural resources such as fuelwood. Climate change can reduce the availability of these local natural resources, limiting the options for rural households that depend on natural resources for consumption or trade. Land may become less fertile; fewer reeds may be available for basketmaking; there may be less local fuelwood for heating. These impacts will progressively increase over this century and will shift the locations where rural economic activities (like agriculture, forestry, and recreation) can thrive.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
              Effects of outbound migration: Rural communities already struggle with outbound migration - leaving them with an ageing population, and lower ratio of economically active population. Climate change, through its negative effects on traditional economic activities, will speed up this process. This in turn, through the reduction of economic diversity, makes these communities more vulnerable - creating a self-exciting point process.
            </p>
            <p class="project-description">
              Lack of economic resilience: Due to their geographic and economic isolation, rural communities are less resilient from an economic perspective - negative changes in one specific economic area (e.g. agriculture) have a rippling effect on the stability of the entire community. Diversity of economic activities makes communities less vulnerable to crises.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project-section">Chosen intervention area</h4>
            <h2 class="project-motto">How might we improve access to reliable information in rural communities to combat misinformation and strengthen civic participation?</h2>

            <p class="project-description">
              In many rural areas, limited access to diverse sources of credible information can make communities more vulnerable to misinformation, fake news, and political propaganda. This can distort public understanding, fuel social divisions, and undermine democratic processes. By increasing access to trustworthy news outlets and fostering critical thinking skills, rural residents can become better informed and more engaged citizens. Community-driven initiatives, local media platforms, and information-sharing networks can help promote transparency, encourage dialogue, and support the resilience of rural communities against external manipulation.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project-section">01</h4>
            <h2 class="project-motto">Research findings</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
              During my research I found that the avoidable mortality rates in Hungary are significantly high. On one hand, this is caused by poor lifestyle choices, such as poor diet, smoking, heavy alcolol consumption, obesity and low physical activity. On the other hand, people in rural areas tend to have limited health literacy.

            <h2 class="project-motto">The Concept</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
              Developing a health app with the mission to promote preventive care and empower individuals through accessible, trustworthy health education. The goal is to raise awareness, correct common misconceptions, and help people make informed decisions about their well-being—ultimately reducing the prevalence of avoidable illnesses and encouraging a proactive approach to personal health. By focusing on clear, reliable information and user-friendly design, the app aims to be a supportive tool for everyday health literacy and long-term wellness.

            <p class="project-description">
              This work was done for a Proposal by the Hungarian Innovation Agency (NIÜ). The mission of NIÜ is to strengthen Hungary's innovation capacity by supporting the evolving needs of the innovation ecosystem, fostering connections between its stakeholders, and promoting innovation-driven culture and mindset. Through the development of the innovation ecosystem map, the NIÜ aims to provide all stakeholders with an accessible, user-friendly platform that consolidates the information, funding, and collaboration opportunities. This initiative supports the realization of innovative projects, fosters connections between universities and companies, and promotes knowledge and technology transfer.

            <p class="project-description">
              Since the target audience of the ecosystem map are the following:
            </p>
            <ul class="project-bullets">
              <li>University and research institute researchers, educators, and students</li>
              <li>Founders and employees of startups and innovative SMEs</li>
              <li>Investors</li>
              <li>Leaders and R&D professionals from large corporations</li>
              <li>Business service providers, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="project-description">
              Given the diverse range of users, from seasoned experts in business, innovation, and funding to those with limited familiarity in these areas, it was crucial to design an interface that caters to all. The challenge was to create an intuitive, accessible platform that simplifies complex information and ensures that every visitor, regardless of their background, can effortlessly find what they need. The result is a user-friendly experience that bridges knowledge gaps and fosters seamless navigation through the wealth of resources available on the platform.

                <p class="split-description">
                  Our task in the NIÜ project was to design the user interface for their website. While the agency provided a clear information structure, the content itself was dense and overwhelming—especially for users unfamiliar with the world of innovation, startups, and funding. Our challenge was to transform this complex information into a clean, intuitive, and accessible interface that makes the ecosystem approachable for all users, regardless of their level of expertise.

                <p class="split-description">
                  To address this challenge, we focused on creating a clear, user-friendly interface that prioritizes accessibility and ease of navigation. We introduced visual hierarchy, intuitive layout patterns, and interactive elements to break down the dense information into digestible sections. By using consistent iconography, simple language, and guided user flows, we made the content approachable for newcomers while still offering depth for experienced users. Our design ensures that each stakeholder—from students to investors—can quickly find relevant information and understand how to engage with the innovation ecosystem.
