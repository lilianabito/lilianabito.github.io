              communities</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
              In this semester project our task was to design an ecosystem intervention, and formalise that intervention in a digital product.

              Physical isolation, limited economic diversity, and higher poverty rates, combined with an ageing population, increase the vulnerability of rural communities to any crisis, including the current permacrisis. Systems of fundamental importance to rural populations are already stressed by remoteness and limited access - climate change is only making this worse.

            <h4 class="project-section">Primary Issues</h4>

            <p class="project-description">  
              Effects of climate change: Rural communities tend to rely heavily on climatesensitive resources such as local water supplies and agricultural land; climate-sensitive activities such as arable farming and livestock husbandry; and natural resources such as fuelwood. Climate change can reduce the availability of these local natural resources, limiting the options for rural households that depend on natural resources for consumption or trade. Land may become less fertile; fewer reeds may be available for basketmaking; there may be less local fuelwood for heating. These impacts will progressively increase over this century and will shift the locations where rural economic activities (like agriculture, forestry, and recreation) can thrive.

              Effects of outbound migration: Rural communities already struggle with outbound migration - leaving them with an ageing population, and lower ratio of economically active population. Climate change, through its negative effects on traditional economic activities, will speed up this process. This in turn, through the reduction of economic diversity, makes these communities more vulnerable - creating a self-exciting point process.

              Lack of economic resilience: Due to their geographic and economic isolation, rural communities are less resilient from an economic perspective - negative changes in one specific economic area (e.g. agriculture) have a rippling effect on the stability of the entire community. Diversity of economic activities makes communities less vulnerable to crises.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project-section">Chosen intervention area</h4>
            <h2 class="project-motto">How might we improve access to reliable information in rural communities to combat misinformation and strengthen civic participation?</h2>

            <p class="project-description">
              In many rural areas, limited access to diverse sources of credible information can make communities more vulnerable to misinformation, fake news, and political propaganda. This can distort public understanding, fuel social divisions, and undermine democratic processes. By increasing access to trustworthy news outlets and fostering critical thinking skills, rural residents can become better informed and more engaged citizens. Community-driven initiatives, local media platforms, and information-sharing networks can help promote transparency, encourage dialogue, and support the resilience of rural communities against external manipulation.
            </p>

            <h4 class="project-section">01</h4>
            <h2 class="project-motto">Research findings</h2>
            <p class="project-description">
              During my research I found that the avoidable mortality rates in Hungary are significantly high. On one hand, this is caused by poor lifestyle choices, such as poor diet, smoking, heavy alcolol consumption, obesity and low physical activity. On the other hand, people in rural areas tend to have limited health literacy:
              Pálinka is good for
the immune system
Ignoring importance
of regular medical
check-ups Reluctance to use
sunscreen
Self-medication with
antibiotics
Ignoring effects of
mental health issues
Reluctance towards
vaccination
Natural remedies for
all ailments
